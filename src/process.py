    """
    Returns a position ID (float) of its position on the page as a decimal from 0 to 1, added on top of the pagenum

    Ex: A page that is 500px tall, with y_1 = 225 and y_2 = 275 on page 5. 
    Average height on page is 250px, so returns .5. Added to the page number gives the Position ID
    of 5.5. This is used to have a scalar value for the absolute position of objects in an entire document, instead of just simple pages. 
    Intended to be used to match up titles and tables that get cut off/on different pages from each other. 

    Arguments: 
        y_1: Lower Y value of the selection 
        y_2: Higher Y value of the selection 
        pagenum: Page number of the page where the selection came from 
        docheight: Height, in pixels, of the array of the document. Defaults to 3850, as that is dpi = 350 of the PDF
